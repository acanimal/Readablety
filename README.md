# Readablety

Readablety is a fork of Readability.
It is derived from source code found at [arc90labs-readability] repository.

See also: [Readability][arc90_labs]

## How it works?

Readable creates an overlay and shows a clearified version of the current web page.
The Readablety fork is a simplified version which offers a function that returns
the clearified web page version, but does not create any overlay, menu, etc.
